Create a function that receives one integer less than 1,000 as a parameter.
This parameter will be the overall total you want to reach. Within the function, 
generate random numbers from 0 to 10. Add the randomly generated numbers until 
they reach the parameter, without letting the sum go over.

Once you’ve reached to the sum, print to the screen 
“it took _____ tries to total ______. Here are the steps:“, followed by a list of 
the randomly generated numbers that you added together. If any of the numbers 
caused the total to go over, print “Too Big” to the screen, along with the number in parenthesis.

Sample output:

It took 10 tries to total 20. Here are the steps:
3
4
5
Too Big (10)
5
Too Big (5)
2
Too Big (4)
Too Big (9)
1

Check to make sure the parameter being passed in is a number and that it is less than 1,000.
Provide comments on your code to make it more readable.
