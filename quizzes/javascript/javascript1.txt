Instructions: Go to https://codepen.io. Click Create button at top right. Create a New Pen for each of the three scripts below. When you have finished writing a script, click Save. Send me the URL for your CodePen in Slack DIRECTLY TO MY ACCOUNT. DON'T PUT THE URL IN THE GENERAL CHANNEL.

Note: In order to view the console in CodePen, you will need to click the Console button on the bottom left.



1. Create a variable named "number" and assign it an integer value. Then write a script that will write out in the console either "This number is larger than 10" or "This number is less than 10" when the script is run.

2. Create an array of the colors in a rainbow (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet). Write a loop that writes all of those colors one by one to the console.

2a. Using the array of colors, write a script that writes a single sentence to the console: "A rainbow is made up of 7 colors. Those colors are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. How pretty!" Extra points if the number 7 is dynamically determined so that if I add a color to the array, the sentence will read "A rainbow is made up of 8 colors..."
